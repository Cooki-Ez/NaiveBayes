The aim is to classify mushrooms from the dataset in agaricus-lepiota.data (source)
as either poisonous (class p) or edible (class e) using the Naive Bayes classifier.
Implement the classifier and test it on the test set in agaricus-lepiota.test.data.
The decision attribute is in the first column.
Use smoothing where necessary.
The program should output the accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure
